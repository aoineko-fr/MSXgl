## Gameplay
Peng-Pong is a fun sports game where two penguins face off using rules inspired by ping-pong and volleyball.

### Rules
Several settings can be customized to tailor the rules:
- `POINTS`: The number of points required to win a match (default: 11)
- `BOUNCES`: The number of ground bounces allowed before the ball must cross the "net" (default: 1)
- `PASSES`: The number of times a player can hit the ball before the ball must cross the "net" (default: 3)

A player scores a point when:
- The ball goes out on the opponent‚Äôs side after bouncing at least once on the ground (if opponent don't touch the ball, it's a "passing")
- The ball goes out on their side without touching them and without bouncing on the ground (the opponent made a "out")
- The opponent lets the ball bounce too many times on their side of the court, or hits it more times than allowed (this is considered a "fault")

### Modes
- `PLY VS PLY`: Face off against a friend (or maybe a future ex-friend?)
- `PLY VS CPU`: Challenge an AI opponent with three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, and Hard)

Note: You can exit a match at any time by pressing the `[Esc]` key.
